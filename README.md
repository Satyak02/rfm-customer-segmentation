  - 💡 KPI Cards – Total Customers, # Champions, Avg Spend, Orders per Customer
  
  - 🍩 Donut Chart – Segment Breakdown
  
  - 📉 Scatter Plot – Frequency vs Monetary
  
  - 📊 Histogram – Recency Distribution
  
  - 📋 Bar Chart – Avg Revenue by Segment
  
  - 📑 Table – Drill-down with RFM scores
  
  - 🎛 Slicers – Filter by Segment, RFM Score, R, F, M

##📊 RFM Analysis

RFM metrics Calculated:

  - Recency: Days since last purchase
  
  - Frequency: Number of unique orders
  
  - Monetary: Total amount spent

Scored each RFM value on a scale of 1–5 and classified customers into segments:

### Segment	(Criteria)

  - Champions	(R=5, F=5, M=5)

  - Loyal Customers	(High R, medium/high F)

  - Frequent Buyers	(F=5)

  - Big Spenders	(M=5)

  - Others	(Remaining customers)

---

## 💡 Key Insights

  - Champions account for a significant share of total revenue.
  
  - Big Spenders shop less frequently but spend heavily.
  
  - Many customers haven’t purchased recently — target for re-engagement.
